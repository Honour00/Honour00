Hi there! I'm **Alabi Usman Ayodeji**, a **Data Analyst** passionate about extracting insights from data to support decision-making.

I enjoy analyzing business data using tools like **Excel**, **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python**, and I'm currently building my portfolio through real-world projects.

My work focuses on:
- Building insightful dashboards and reports for various domains (sales, healthcare, operations, and more)
- Cleaning and transforming raw data into analysis-ready datasets
- Uncovering patterns, trends, and insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Communicating findings clearly using visualizations and data storytelling

I believe in learning by doing, and I’m documenting every step of my journey(one dataset at a time).

I’m open to:
- **Internship opportunities**
- **Entry-level/remote job roles**
- **Collaborations with other analysts or developers**
- **Mentorship (both giving and receiving)**
