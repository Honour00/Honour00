Hi there! I'm **Alabi Usman Ayodeji**, a **Data Analyst** passionate about extracting insights from data to support decision-making.

I enjoy analyzing business data using tools like **Excel**, **Power BI**, **SQL**, and **Python**, and I'm currently building my portfolio through real-world projects.

My work focuses on:
- Interactive dashboards & reports
- Sales and revenue performance tracking
- Market and customer segmentation
- Data storytelling and visualization

I believe in learning by doing, and Iâ€™m documenting every step of my journey(one dataset at a time).

Open to internships, collaborations, and mentorship opportunities.
